# Hi, I'm Lukas 👋

I'm a Mechanical Engineering student with a strong focus on **robotics**, **hardware-near control**, and the **intersection of mechanics, control theory, and software-based perception**.

I enjoy building systems where physical hardware, mathematical models, and clean software abstractions meet — especially in robotics, simulation, and control pipelines.

## 🔧 Current Focus

- **Robotics & Control**
  - ROS2 (Jazzy), Gazebo / gz-sim
  - Joint-level control, trajectory generation, inverse kinematics
  - URDF / Xacro, ros2_control

- **Mechanical & Systems Engineering**
  - Rigid-body kinematics and dynamics
  - Actuation, transmissions, physical constraints
  - Hardware-aware system design

- **Software Engineering**
  - C++ (hardware-near, performance-critical code)
  - Python (tooling, prototyping, robotics workflows)
  - Clean architecture, reproducibility, documentation

## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🦾 `ros2_6dof_arm_control`
ROS2-based control pipeline for a simulated 6-DoF robotic arm.

**Highlights**
- Gazebo simulation with ros2_control
- Joint trajectory control & state broadcasting
- URDF/Xacro-based robot description
- Designed as a foundation for IK, trajectory planning, and higher-level behaviors

> Focus: **engineering-grade robotics software**, not just demos.

### 🎨 `monocircuit`
Design-focused work exploring the intersection of **static and dynamic graphics**, systems thinking, and visual structure.

---

## 🎯 Long-Term Direction

- Robotics & intelligent physical systems
- Hardware-near engineering roles in innovative technology companies
- Long-term interest in **founding or contributing to technically deep, product-driven ventures**
